        <p class="lead text-left">
          Global data science lead at NASDAQ listed company Cimpress and part-time machine learning researcher. Strategic thinker and technology evangelist. Doing interesting things in a boring but thorough way. Worked hard and played hard at top tier management consultancy and big four audit firm.
        </p>
        <h3 class="text-left">Professional experience</h3>
        <p class="text-left">
          Currently, I'm a Data Science Manager within the NASDAQ listed company <a href="www.cimpress.com" target="_blank">Cimpress</a> responsible globally for our site product recommendation models. Prior to that, I ran data mining techniques to identify patterns in customer behaviour. Furthermore, I applied machine learning on unstructured text data to extract strong segmentation signals. The creation of dashboards and running statistical tests to measure and track the performance of marketing activities were also part of my work. Moreover, I coach and train more junior colleagues. My toolset includes collaborative filtering, statistical data analysis (both Bayesian and frequentist), unsupervised pattern recognition and supervised classification methods, and scalable data processing pipelines in Apache Spark.
        </p>
        <p class="text-left">
          I worked on high-level strategy projects during my time at <a href="www.bcg.com" target="_blank">The Boston Consulting Group</a> as a specialist in the area of data analytics. I performed data analyses and built predictive models for a variety of data sets ranging from pricing, procurement, customer intelligence, or portfolio optimization. Furthermore, I developed analytical tools and prototypes of management information systems. Moreover, I coached and trained junior colleagues.
        </p>
        <p class="text-left">
          During my time at the big four audit company <a href="www.pwc.com" target="_blank">PricewaterhouseCoopers</a>, I performed IT and process audits and subsequently advised my clients how to improve their processes and IT systems. Furthermore I performed forensic data analyses in order to identify fraud.
        </p>
        <p class="text-left">
          In 2008, I did an internship at cominvest Asset Management in the area of investment fund sales reporting. cominvest was eventually merged by absorption with <a href="www.allianzgi.com" target="_blank">Allianz Global Investors</a>.
        <p class="text-left">
          During my time at the University of Muenster, I worked as a student assistant at the <a href="http://www.marketingcenter.de/mcm/" target="_blank">Marketing Center Muenster</a> primarily responsible for survey design and implementation, and data pre-processing for several analyses like cluster or conjoint analysis.
        </p>
